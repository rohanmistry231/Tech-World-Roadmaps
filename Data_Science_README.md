## 🌟 What is Data Science?
Data Science is the art and science of extracting meaningful insights from data using statistical methods, computational algorithms, and domain knowledge. It spans data collection, cleaning, exploration, modeling, and interpretation to drive decisions in industries like tech (e.g., Google’s search algorithms), finance (e.g., credit risk scoring), healthcare (e.g., cancer detection), e-commerce (e.g., Amazon’s product recommendations), and more. In 2025, it’s evolving with trends like:
- **Generative AI**: Using LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for data synthesis or augmentation.
- **Ethical AI**: Addressing bias and fairness in models (EU AI Act compliance).
- **AutoML**: Tools like Google AutoML for rapid prototyping.
- **Edge Analytics**: Real-time processing on IoT devices.
- **Quantum-Inspired Algorithms**: For massive dataset optimization.

The workflow often follows **CRISP-DM** (Business Understanding → Data Collection → Preparation → Modeling → Evaluation → Deployment) or **OSEMN** (Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, iNterpret), emphasizing iterative experimentation and storytelling with data.
