## üåü What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud Computing provides on-demand access to computing resources‚Äîservers, storage, databases, networking, software‚Äîvia the internet, eliminating the need for physical infrastructure. It‚Äôs built on virtualization, enabling scalable, cost-effective solutions. Key service models:
- **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service): Virtual machines, storage (e.g., AWS EC2, S3).
- **PaaS** (Platform as a Service): Development platforms (e.g., Google App Engine).
- **SaaS** (Software as a Service): End-user apps (e.g., Google Workspace).
- **FaaS** (Function as a Service): Serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda).
In 2025, trends include edge computing for low-latency IoT, hybrid/multi-cloud for flexibility, cloud-native AI (e.g., SageMaker), and green cloud (sustainable data centers). Workflows follow: Requirements ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Monitor ‚Üí Optimize.
