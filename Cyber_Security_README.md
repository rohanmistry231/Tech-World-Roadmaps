## üåü What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity protects systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. It spans threat prevention (firewalls, encryption), detection (intrusion systems), response (incident handling), and recovery (backups). Key areas:
- **Network Security**: Secure firewalls, VPNs.
- **Application Security**: Secure coding, vulnerability scanning.
- **Endpoint Security**: Protect devices (e.g., laptops, mobiles).
- **Cloud Security**: Secure AWS, Azure deployments.
- **Incident Response**: Mitigate breaches, forensics.
In 2025, trends include AI-powered threat detection, quantum cryptography, zero-trust models, and IoT security. Workflows follow NIST Cybersecurity Framework: Identify ‚Üí Protect ‚Üí Detect ‚Üí Respond ‚Üí Recover.
